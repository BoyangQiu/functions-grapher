<i>Description:</i> A tool which allows for two functions to be graphed, allowing for the comparison between them and visualizing the
relative transformations between them. The functions are inputted as a function of x into the GUI and the range which they will be plotted
can also be specified (set to -10, 10 by default).

<i>Note</i>: Functions MUST be inputted as a function of x and Pythonic mathematical operators must be used. Square roots can be inputted 
as 'sqrt'.
